# Improved Scheduling Logic for Even Distribution Mode

## Overview

The scheduling logic for the "even" distribution mode has been significantly improved to better handle extra hours that couldn't be scheduled during the initial distribution. The new system implements a multi-round redistribution approach that continues until all possible hours are scheduled or no more available time slots exist. Additionally, the system now combines sessions of the same task to create more efficient study blocks.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multi-Round Redistribution

**Before**: The system only attempted one round of redistribution per task, which often left many hours unscheduled.

**After**: The system now implements a `redistributeUnscheduledHours` helper function that:
- Continues redistributing hours across multiple rounds (up to 10 rounds to prevent infinite loops)
- Tracks remaining unscheduled hours after each round
- Stops only when no more hours can be distributed or no available days remain

### 2. Session Combination

**Before**: Multiple small sessions of the same task could be created on the same day, leading to fragmented study time.

**After**: The system now includes session combination logic that:
- Combines multiple sessions of the same task on the same day into larger, more efficient sessions
- Reduces the number of small, fragmented sessions
- Creates more practical and productive study blocks
- Applies combination after initial scheduling and after global redistribution

### 3. Optimized Session Distribution

**Before**: Sessions were distributed evenly without considering optimal session lengths.

**After**: The system now uses `optimizeSessionDistribution` that:
- Tries to create fewer, larger sessions instead of many small ones
- Considers minimum and maximum session length constraints
- Prefers sessions of 2-4 hours when possible
- Distributes remaining hours efficiently across available days

### 4. Minimum Session Length Consideration

The improved logic now considers the minimum session length when redistributing hours:
- If the calculated hours per day is less than the minimum session length, it tries to distribute to fewer days
- This ensures that sessions are practical and meet the user's minimum session requirements
- Prevents creation of very small, impractical sessions

### 5. Global Redistribution Pass

After processing all tasks individually, the system now performs a global redistribution pass:
- Identifies all tasks that still have unscheduled hours
- Sorts them by importance and deadline priority
- Attempts to redistribute remaining hours across all available days within each task's deadline
- Provides a final opportunity to schedule any remaining hours

### 6. Better Logging and Debugging

The improved system includes comprehensive logging:
- Tracks how many hours are being redistributed for each task
- Reports when tasks still have unscheduled hours after redistribution
- Provides visibility into the redistribution process

## Algorithm Flow

1. **Initial Distribution**: Distribute each task's hours using optimized session distribution
2. **Session Combination**: Combine sessions of the same task on the same day
3. **Per-Task Redistribution**: For each task with unscheduled hours:
   - Find available days within the task's deadline
   - Redistribute hours using optimized session distribution
   - Consider minimum session length requirements
   - Stop when no more hours can be distributed
4. **Global Redistribution**: After all tasks are processed:
   - Identify all tasks with remaining unscheduled hours
   - Sort by importance and deadline
   - Attempt final redistribution across all available days
   - Combine sessions again after redistribution
5. **Time Slot Assignment**: Assign specific time slots to all scheduled sessions
6. **Suggestion Generation**: Create suggestions for any remaining unscheduled hours

## Benefits

- **Higher Scheduling Efficiency**: More hours get scheduled due to multiple redistribution rounds
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Takes advantage of any remaining capacity across all available days
- **Practical Sessions**: Ensures sessions meet minimum length requirements and combines small sessions
- **Improved User Experience**: Fewer unscheduled hours and more efficient study blocks
- **Reduced Fragmentation**: Combines multiple small sessions into larger, more productive blocks

## Example Scenario

Consider a task with 10 hours that needs to be completed by Friday:
- **Available Days**: Monday (4h), Tuesday (2h), Wednesday (4h), Thursday (4h), Friday (4h)
- **Initial Distribution**: 2.5 hours per day = 10 hours total
- **Session Combination**: If multiple sessions are created on the same day, they get combined
- **If Tuesday gets filled**: Remaining 7.5 hours redistributed across Mon, Wed, Thu, Fri = ~1.9 hours each
- **If Wednesday also gets filled**: Remaining 5.6 hours redistributed across Mon, Thu, Fri = ~1.9 hours each
- **Continues until**: All hours are scheduled or no more capacity exists

This approach ensures maximum utilization of available time while maintaining practical session lengths and creating efficient study blocks.
